This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of rpncalc, a RPN calculator.
This package was put together by David Frey <dfrey@debian.org>,
from local sources.

Changes:
 * added Debian GNU/Linux package maintenance system files
 * renamed calc (original package name) into rpncalc to avoid possible
   confusion with the better known emacs calc package.
